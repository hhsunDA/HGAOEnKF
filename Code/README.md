# A Matlab Version of Hybrid Gain Analog Offline EnKF for Paleoclimate Data Assimilation

This repository contains a matlab implementation of an offline paleoclimate data assimilation (PDA) for the reconstruction of annual surface air temperature (SAT) and sea surface temperature (SST). Please see the Web-based [documentation](https://lilisgroup.github.io/PaleoDA_docs/) for more details. 

## Key Components

- `AOEnKF`: Run localization sensitivity experiments for the analog offline EnKF (AOEnKF).

- `AOEnKF_B`: Run localization sensitivity experiments for the analog offline EnKF with static B (AOEnKF_B).

- `HGAOEnKF`: Run hybrid weights sensitivity experiments for the hybrid gain analog offline EnKF (HGAOEnKF).
