# A Matlab Version of Hybrid Gain Analog Offline EnKF for Paleoclimate Data Assimilation

This repository contains a matlab implementation of an offline paleoclimate data assimilation (PDA) for the reconstruction of annual surface air temperature (SAT) and sea surface temperature (SST). Please see the Web-based [documentation](https://lilisgroup.github.io/PaleoDA_docs/) for more details. 

## Key Components

- `Code`: Run sensitivity experiments for different PDA methods.

- `Data`: Data prepocessing. If you are interested, please refer to the [NJU box link](https://box.nju.edu.cn/d/76f4c79a4dda4e6da6ac/).
